# netflix-data-analysis
This is a personal project I did to practice some Data Analytics skills.  
Dataset comes from kaggle. I do not own the dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows  
Dataset is in a CSV file format. It contains shows that are/were available in Netflix and contains 8807 records and 12 attributes.  
Attributes: show_id, type, title, director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, description
